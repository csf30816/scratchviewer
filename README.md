# Scratch Viewer
Thanks to Phosphorus, and the Phosphorus Team for the origonal source code modified by me. This is free and open source, just like the origonal. It is used to view <a href="scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> projects.
## Updates
- Added SVG viewing in projects, for phosphorus did not have that working

- Added new CSS layout for player
