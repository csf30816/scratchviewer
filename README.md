# Scratch Viewer
Thanks to Phosphorus, and the Phosphorus Team for the origonal source code modified by me. This is free and open source, just like the origonal. It is used to view <a href="scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> projects.
## Updates

- Added new CSS layout for player

- Added new Favicon.ico file. Resembles the Green Flag, the symbol of running Scratch
##Coming Soon
